This folder contains the training sets for the unconditional monodentate and bidentate models and the corresponding trained models.

The fork used to train the models can be found at: [FastJTNNpy3](https://github.com/Strandgaard96/FastJTNNpy3)
The fork also contains code to do directional optimization in latent space.
